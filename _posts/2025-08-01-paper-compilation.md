# ([2504.16929](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16929)) I‑Con: A Unifying Framework for Representation Learning 

Proposes a single equation aiming to unify diverse machine learning approaches—including clustering, contrastive learning, supervised learning, and dimensionality reduction—under a common framework. The method is fundamentally based on the KL divergence between two data distributions, *p* and *q*, where *p* represents the probability density of the true data and *q* the learned model distribution.

This framework aspires to act as a “periodic table of machine learning”, suggesting that the current gaps within this formulation may inspire new model types or architectural innovations.
