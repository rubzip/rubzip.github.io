# 2D Geometry

## 2D Pose

In robotics, a **pose** is defined as the set of parameters that completely describe a robot’s **location** and **orientation** in the plane. Two types of parameters are used:

* those that model the **position**,
* and those that represent the **orientation**.

In $$\mathbb{R}^2$$ a pose is fully described by **3 parameters**:

* **Position**: coordinates $$(x, y)$$
* **Orientation**: orientation angle $$(\theta)$$ with respect to a reference axis

Thus, any pose in 2D can be expressed as:

$$
\xi = (x, y, \theta)
$$

## Robotics notation

Let (A) be a *coordinate frame* and (B) a point. We define

$$\space^{A}p_{B}$$

as the position vector of point (B) expressed in coordinate frame (A).

Similarly, the pose of one reference frame with respect to another can be expressed as:

$$\space^{A}\xi_{B}$$

which represents the **pose of system (B) with respect to system (A)**.

---

## Composition of frames

Positions and poses are different entities and therefore **cannot be directly operated together**. However, they can be **properly composed**.

For example, the relative position with respect to frame (A) can be obtained from the relative position with respect to (B):

$$
\space^{A}p = \space^{A}\xi_{B} \cdot \space^{B}p
$$

Likewise, three frames can be related through pose composition:

$$
\space^{A}\xi_{C} = \space^{A}\xi_{B} \oplus \space^{B}\xi_{C}
$$

## Pose algebra

Below is a summary of the fundamental operations defined on poses (pose algebra):

### Pose inverse

The **inverse pose** undoes the transformation of a pose. If a pose is applied and then its inverse, we return to the origin:

$$
\xi^{-1} \oplus \xi = 0
$$

### Pose addition

Addition corresponds to the **composition of transformations**:

* It is not commutative.
* It is not distributive.
* It represents applying one pose after another.

### Useful properties

* $$\space^X\xi_Y \oplus \space^Y\xi_Z = \space^X\xi_Z$$
* $$\xi_{1} \oplus \xi_{2} \neq \xi_{2} \oplus {\xi}_{1}$$
* $$\ominus \space^X\xi_Y = \space^Y\xi_X$$
* $$\xi \ominus \xi = 0$$
* $$\ominus \xi \oplus \xi = 0$$
* $$\xi \ominus 0 = \xi$$
* $$\xi \oplus 0 = \xi$$

## Developing a real representation of pose in 2D

Any 2D pose can be described as the composition of a rotation and a translation.

### 2D rotations

Any rotation in 2D can be defined in the space $$SO(2)$$:

$$
R(\theta) = \begin{pmatrix}
\cos\theta & \sin\theta \\
-\sin\theta & \cos\theta
\end{pmatrix}
$$

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
x' \\ y'
\end{pmatrix}
=
R
\begin{pmatrix}
x \\ y
\end{pmatrix}
$$

### 2D translations

As with 2D rotations, we seek an operator that maps any 2D position to its translated version:

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
x + \Delta \\ y
\end{pmatrix} =
T_x(\Delta)
\begin{pmatrix}
x \\ y
\end{pmatrix}
$$

Let us derive the values:

$$T_x(\Delta, y) = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & \frac{\Delta}{y}  \\
0 & 1 \\
\end{pmatrix}
$$

As we see, **a translation matrix $$(T_x(\Delta))$$ in $$\mathbb{R}^{2\times 2}$$ does not exist**, since the derived matrix depends on the vector’s position being translated: $$T_x(\Delta, y)$$.

## Homogeneous form

As a solution to the previously described problem, a new coordinate system is introduced, called the homogeneous form:

$$
\tilde{p} = \begin{pmatrix}x \\ y \\ 1\end{pmatrix}
$$

This allows the definition of a translation operator that depends only on the displacement distance:

$$
T_x(\Delta) = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & \Delta \\
0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
$$

The rotation matrix is also modified in homogeneous form:

$$
R(\theta) = \begin{pmatrix}
\cos\theta & \sin\theta & 0\\
-\sin\theta & \cos\theta & 0\\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
$$

All other operators are modified as well, for example scalar multiplication in homogeneous form:

$$
\lambda = \begin{pmatrix}
\lambda & 0 & 0 \\
0 & \lambda & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
$$

The pose transformation matrix is defined as:

$$
\space^{A}\xi_{B} \sim \space^{A}T_{B} =
\begin{pmatrix}
\cos\theta & -\sin\theta & t_x \\
\sin\theta & \cos\theta & t_y \\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
$$

With the properties:

* $$\space^{A}\xi_{B} \oplus \space^{B}\xi_{C} \sim \space^{A}T_{B} \space^{B}T_{C}$$
* $$\ominus \xi \sim T^{-1}$$
