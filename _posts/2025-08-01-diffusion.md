*These are some notes I took while studying diffusion models.*

# Diffusion models for denoising

The ideal for generating images would be to define a probabilistic distribution containing all image content, and after that generate the image through a random process based on weighted probability as LLM does. But this is a huge task, and at the moment it is not possible.

Diffusion models propose a process to achieve image generation thoug a similar method: to develop a neural network-based model that is able to gradually remove Gaussian noise from an image. So starting from any image generaeted through a Gaussian noise distribution $$\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$$, converge to image space after a finite number of $$\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$$ steps.

# Noising Process

To train this type of model, the first step is to develop an algorithm that takes any image and converts it to white noise in a finite number of steps. This will act as a starting point for our model which we will train to do the reverse process.

## Initial approach

One method that could be considered is to simply add white noise step by step:

$$
x_{t} = x_{t-1} + \beta \cdot \epsilon 
$$

$$
x_{t} = x_{0} + \sqrt{t} \cdot \beta \cdot \epsilon 
$$

---

**Notation**: 

- $$x_0$$ refers to the original image
- $$x_t$$ image adter applying t-steps of noising
- $$\beta$$ corresponds to the weight of noise
- $$\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1)$$ is the noise added each step generated throug a normal distribution

Noising process example on an image over 500 steps. For testing if each distribution was likely a $$\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$$ distribution, it was applied Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.

The problem with this method is that the distribution diverges at: 

$$
\lim_{t \to \infty} x_t \sim \lim_{\sigma \to \infty} \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)
$$

This phenomenon is called *variance exploitation*.

## Diffusion method

An alternative method is proposed in the original paper:

$$
x_{t} = \sqrt{\alpha_t} \cdot x_{t-1} + \sqrt{1 - \alpha_t} \cdot \epsilon_t
$$

$$
x_{t} = \sqrt{\bar{\alpha_t}} \cdot x_{0} + \sqrt{1 - \bar{\alpha_t}} \cdot \epsilon
$$

With $$\alpha_t = 1 - \beta_t, \space \space \space \bar{\alpha_t} = \prod_{s=1}^{t} \alpha_s$$.

It could be shown that this distribution already converges to a normal distribution:

$$
\lim_{t \to \infty} x_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1)
$$

We have already defined a successful method that converges to a standardized normal distribution.

## Markov chain notation

The *forward process* or *diffusion process* is defined as a Markov chain: 

$$
q(x_{1}x_{2}...x_{T}|x_{0}) = q(x_{1:T}|x_{0}) = \prod_{t=1}^{T} q(x_{t}|x_{t-1})
$$

Where q is the probability density function of obtaining the value $$x_t$$ from the value $$x_{t-1}$$.

$$
q(x_t \mid x_{t-1}) = \mathcal{N}(x_t; \sqrt{1 - \beta_t} \cdot x_{t-1}, \beta_t I)
$$

---

**Notation:**

$$\mathcal{N}(x, \mu, \sigma)$$ refers to the density probability function of normal distribution having the value x. To obtain the probability it must be integrated over the entire image space.

$$
Q(x_{1:T}|x_{0}) = \int \prod_{t=1}^{T} q(x_{t}|x_{t-1}) dx_{1:T}
$$

---

# Denoising Process

The *inverse process* is defined as the denoising process that converts a denoised image $$x_T$$ into a functional image. The whole process can be defined as a Markov chain:

$$
p_{\theta}(x_{0:T}) = p_{\theta}(x_{T}) \prod_{t=1}^{T}p_{\theta}(x_{t-1}|x_{t})
$$

Since by definition it starts from white noise, probability of the initial noise state could be considered as:

$$
p_{\theta}(x_{T}) = \mathcal{N}(x_{T}, 0, I) 
$$

---

**Notation:**

$$\theta$$ refers to the parameters of the neural network. If any element contains $$\theta$$ it means that it was calculated through NN and its parameters.

---

By definition $$p_\theta$$  and $$q$$ are inverse processes of themselves. It can be shown that the inverse process of a Gaussian is a Gaussian (reference to demonstration) so:

$$
p_{\theta}(x_{t-1}|x_{t}) = \mathcal{N}(x_{t-1}, \mu_{\theta}(x_{t}, t), \sigma_{\theta}(x_{t}, t))
$$

# Loss Function

Now that we have defined the stochastic process, it is time to define the loss function, as we have a probability density function over images, higer the probability of a generated image it is, better the image it is. Taking this into account the loss function could be defined as:

$$
\mathcal{L}= \mathbb{E}[-\log p_\theta (x_0)]
$$

With $$\mathbb{E}$$ referred as the mean value over all the examples and $$p_\theta(x_0)$$ could be obtained by integrating:

$$
p_\theta(x_0) = \int p_\theta(x_{0:T}) dx_{1:T}
$$

Since it is not computationally possible to integrate over all the values, an approximation based on Jensen's inequality is made.

### Evidence lower bound (ELBO)

 From an equation:

$$
\log p(x) = \log \int p(x, z) dz = \log \int q(z \mid x) \frac{p(x, z)}{q(z \mid x)} dz
$$

Applying Jensen Inequality (for convex functions):

$$
f(\mathbb{E}[X]) \ge \mathbb{E}[f(X)]
$$

$$
\log p(x) \ge \log \int q(z \mid x) \frac{p(x, z)}{q(z \mid x)} dz
$$

Resulting in what is known as the ELBO function:

$$
\text{ELBO}(x) = \mathbb{E}_{q(z \mid x)} [\log p(x, z) - \log q(z \mid x)]
$$

This applied to the previous defined loss function:

$$
\mathcal{L} = \mathbb{E}_q[-\log \frac{p_\theta(x_{0:T})}{q(x_{1:T}\mid x_0))}] \ge \mathbb{E}[-\log p_\theta(x_0)]
$$

Using log function properties:

$$
\mathcal{L} = \mathbb{E}_q [-\log \frac{p_{\theta}(x_{T}) \prod_{t=1}^{T}p_{\theta}(x_{t-1}|x_{t})}{\prod_{t=1}^{T} q(x_{t}|x_{t-1})} ]
$$

$$
 = \mathbb{E}_q [-\log p_{\theta}(x_{T}) - \sum_{t=1}^{T} \log \frac{p_{\theta}(x_{t-1}|x_{t})}{q(x_{t}|x_{t-1})} ]
$$

$$
= \mathbb{E}_q [-\log\frac{p_\theta(x_T)}{q(x_T \mid x_0)} - \sum_{t>1}^{T} \log \frac{p_{\theta}(x_{t-1}|x_{t})}{q(x_{t-1}|x_{t},x_0)} - \log p_\theta (x_0 \mid x_1) ]
$$

$$
= \mathbb{E}_q [D_{\text{KL}}(q(x_T \mid x_0) \mid\mid p_\theta(x_T)) + \sum_{t>1}^{T} D_{\text{KL}}(q(x_{t-1}|x_{t},x_0)\mid\mid p_{\theta}(x_{t-1}|x_{t})) - \log p_\theta (x_0 \mid x_1) ]
$$

$$
= \mathcal{L}_T + \sum_{t>1}^{T} \mathcal{L}_{t-1} + \mathcal{L}_0
$$

Where the new terms that depend on the original image are defined by Bayes theorem as:

$$
q(x_{t−1} \mid x_t, x_0) \propto q(x_t \mid x_{t−1}) q(x_{t−1} \mid x_0)
$$

$$
q(x_{t-1} \mid x_t, x_0) = \mathcal{N}\left(x_{t-1}; \mu_t(x_t, x_0), \tilde{\beta}_t I \right)
$$

Where:

$$
\mu_t(x_t, x_0) = \frac{\sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_{t-1}} \, \beta_t}{1 - \bar{\alpha}_t} x_0 + \frac{\sqrt{\alpha_t} (1 - \bar{\alpha}_{t-1})}{1 - \bar{\alpha}_t} x_t
$$

$$
\tilde{\beta}_t = \frac{1 - \bar{\alpha}_{t-1}}{1 - \bar{\alpha}_t} \beta_t
$$

## Computing Divergence of 2 Gaussians

As every distribution is considered gaussian, computing the divergence would be:

$$
D_{\text{KL}}(p \mid\mid q) = \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} p(x) \log\frac{p(x)}{q(x)} dx
$$

$$
D_{KL}(p \| q) = \frac{1}{2} \left[\log \frac{|\Sigma_q|}{|\Sigma_p|} - d + \mathrm{tr}(\Sigma_q^{-1} \Sigma_p) + (\mu_p - \mu_q)^T \Sigma_q^{-1} (\mu_p - \mu_q)\right]
$$

But the mean and deviation of the distributions are not known, so we have to stimate through numeric methods.

An approach that could be used is Monte Carlo

$$
 D_{KL}(p \| q) = \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p} \left[ \log \frac{p(x)}{q(x)} \right] 
\approx \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \log \frac{p(x_i)}{q(x_i)}, \; x_i \sim p 
$$

But computing it though this methods add a high variance so it is computed thoug Rao-Blackwellized fashion:

$$
D_{KL}(p \| q) = \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p} \left[ \log \frac{p(x)}{q(x)} \right] = \mathbb{E}_{x_1} \left[ \mathbb{E}_{x_2 \mid x_1} \left[ \log \frac{p(x_1, x_2)}{q(x_1, x_2)} \right] \right]
$$

By numeric methods:

$$
D_{KL}(p \| q) \approx \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} g(x_1^{(i)})
$$

$$
g(x_1^{(i)}) = \log \frac{p(x_1^{(i)})}{q(x_1^{(i)})} + D_{KL}(p(x_2 \mid x_1^{(i)}) \| q(x_2 \mid x_1^{(i)}))
$$

## Analyzing loss function

### Noised image contribution

$$
\mathcal{L}_T = D_{\text{KL}}(q(x_T \mid x_0) \mid\mid p_\theta(x_T))
$$

As $$x_T$$ is generated thoug a normal standard distribution and no apportation of NN weights to the computation of this loss and we consider as hyperparameters $$\beta_t$$ in terms of model optimizaation we consider $$\mathcal{L}_T$$ as  a **constant loss function in terms of $$\theta$$**.

### Noising process contribution

$$
\mathcal{L}_{t-1} = D_{\text{KL}}(q(x_{t-1}|x_{t},x_0)\mid\mid p_{\theta}(x_{t-1}|x_{t}))
$$

As working with normal distributions is easier, it is considered that both distributions are gaussians:

$$
q(x_{t-1}|x_{t},x_0) = \mathcal{N}(\mu_\theta, \sigma_\theta)
$$

$$
p_{\theta}(x_{t-1}|x_{t}) = \mathcal{N}(\tilde{\mu_t}, \tilde{\beta_t})
$$

Now divergence results as simple as (considering $$\sigma_\theta$$ constant for ovidding overfitting):

$$
\mathcal{L}_{t-1} = D_{\text{KL}}\left( \mathcal{N}(\mu_\theta, \sigma^2) \,\|\, \mathcal{N}(\tilde{\mu}_t, \sigma^2) \right) = \frac{1}{2\sigma^2} \left\| \tilde{\mu}_t - \mu_\theta \right\|^2
$$

### Denoised image contribution

If we suppose that we are working with unit8 images, each pixel contains a number between 0 and 255, we are going to work with this values normalized into the interval [-1, 1]. If we consider a pixel discrete pixel value into a continues space we should consider:

$$
x \rightarrow [x - \frac{1}{255}, x + \frac{1}{255}]
$$

This transformation fully transforms discrete pixel values into continous space. For completion into the real space, we consider in limits intervals: $$(+\infty, x + \frac{1}{255}]$$ and $$[x - \frac{1}{255}, +\infty)$$.

So the result of conditioned probability would be the integral over each pixel (and channel) $$D$$:

$$
p_\theta (x_0 \mid x_1) = \prod_{d=1}^{D}\int_{\delta_-(x_0^d)}^{\delta_-(x_0^d)} \mathcal{N} (x; \mu_\theta(x_1, 1), \sigma_{1}^{2} I) dx
$$

$$
\delta_+(x) = \begin{cases}x + \frac{1}{255} & \text{if } x < 1 \\+\infty & \text{if } x = 1\end{cases}, \quad \delta_-(x) = \begin{cases}x - \frac{1}{255} & \text{if } x > -1 \\-\infty & \text{if } x = -1\end{cases}
$$

**Observation**: For generating less biased models finally only $$\mu_\theta$$ depends on the model parameter model deviation is not considered.

# Simplified loss function
As we previously said, $$\mathcal{L}_T$$ is not dependant on $$\theta$$. As the amount of steps is in order of 500, we are not considering anymore $$\mathcal{L}_0$$.

$$
\mathcal{L} \approx \sum_{t=1}^{T} \mathcal{L}_{t-1} =  \mathbb{E}_{q,t} \left [ \frac{\beta_{t}^{2}} {2 \sigma_t^2 \alpha_t (1 - \bar{\alpha_t})} \left\| \epsilon  - \epsilon _\theta (x_t, t) \right\|^{2} \right ]
$$

The loss function is trained to be able to predict the noise that was added to an image at any step.

## Training loop

1. Sample $$x_0 \sim q(x_0)$$  
2. Sample $$t \sim \text{Uniform}(\{1, \dots, T\})$$  
3. Sample $$\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)$$
4. Compute the noised image

   $$x_t = \sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_t}x_0 + \sqrt{1 - \bar{\alpha}_t}\epsilon$$
5. Take gradient descent step on the difference between the predicted noise and the actual noise

   $$\nabla_\theta \big\| \epsilon - \epsilon_\theta(x_t\, t) \big\|^2$$  

## Generation loop

1. Sample $$x_T \sim \mathcal{N}(\textbf{0}, \textbf{I})$$
2. **for** t = T, ..., 1 **do**
3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sample $$z \sim \mathcal{N}(\textbf{0}, \textbf{I}) \text{if} t > 1 else z = \textbf{0}$$  
4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compute the denoised image

$$x_{t-1} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\alpha_t}}  \left( x_t - \frac{1 - \alpha_t}{\sqrt{1 - \bar{\alpha}_t}} \, \varepsilon_\theta(x_t, t) \right) + \sigma_t z$$
5. **endfor**
