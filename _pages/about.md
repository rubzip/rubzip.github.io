## About Me
I’m Rubén, a predoctoral researcher at the Universidade de Santiago de Compostela. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Physics, but my current focus lies in Machine Learning research. I mostly enjoy science, technology, and cinema.

### Research Interests
---
My research interests include efficient neural architectures, diffusion models, and the application of machine learning to physical domains such as audio processing, hyperspectral imaging, and time series analysis.

### Current Work
---
I am currently working on designing deep learning models in a knowledge transfer project between academia and the forestry industry.

### Previous Work
---
My most recent work was at Huawei, where I developed audio deep learning models optimized to run on embedded devices. I mainly worked on Acoustic Scene Classification.
